# Multiplicity
This JavaScript multiplication practice game was created as a personal project in March 2021 to motivate an elementary schooler in remedial math to practice multiplication by implementing personalization functions and a scoreboard. This studentâ€™s teacher noted that the student requested it daily and showed
significant improvement in multiplication ability.
